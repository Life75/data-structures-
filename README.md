# Data Structures in Action 
## Created by Austyn Washington 

The reason for the creation of this project was to help see data structures in motion and be able to grasp the concept better through visualization. This project was also a test and showcase of my abilities programming thus far in my journey. I've been able to understand different concepts of UI/UX design along with programmatic design patterns to assist greatly with the creation of this project. Working with tools such as Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, Element-Plus, HTML, CSS and more tools in my repertoire has been a pleasure and great learning experience. 

Not only was this a learning project for myself, but a project that others can learn from as well. I've had great fun working on this project and hopefully others will be able to understand more on how to use data structures along with the different pros and cons associated with their respected algorithim.

# Future projection plans 

This is a solo one man project so this project won't be recieving constant updates since I'm typically working on multiple different projects at the same time. Since this one is at a stable version I'll be adding incrementally and setting deliverables for the future. I do want to add more sorting alogrithims along with Data structures (like binary trees for example) in the future! The core intent has been accomplished, but there's much more to explore beyond the horizon as well for this project and I look forward to it and hope you the reader do as well!
