# Data Structures in Action 
## Created by Austyn Washington 

This project brings data structures and sorting algorithms to life through interactive visualizations. Watch in real-time as different sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort organize data, helping you understand their inner workings and performance characteristics.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of multiple sorting algorithms
- Real-time performance metrics
- Adjustable animation speeds
- Customizable data set sizes
- Clean, modern UI built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack
- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Element Plus
- Vite

## Project Roadmap
Future enhancements planned:
- Additional sorting algorithms
- Tree data structure visualizations (Binary Trees, AVL Trees)
- Search algorithm demonstrations
- Performance comparison tools
- More interactive learning features

## Development
This project serves both as a learning tool for others and a showcase of modern web development practices. The codebase demonstrates:
- Clean architecture principles
- TypeScript type safety
- Component-based design
- Responsive UI/UX
- Performance optimization
